# Roll a Ball Evolved
 The classic Unity [Roll a Ball](https://learn.unity.com/project/roll-a-ball) tutorial evolved with Unity Gaming Services functionality.

 The [DevLog](/Docs/DEVLOG.md) contains details of the development from start to finish and there will be individual logs for each service integrated.

 The project is wired to this Unity Dashboard Project
